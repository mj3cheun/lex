    <h1>"Free Text" Search with Lex</h1>
    <p>The goal of this example is to convey how "free text" searching can be accomplished with Lex. Developers can register patterns (regexes) which correspond to known Token values. As a user types, suggestions will be presented based on matches with these patterns and, once selected, a fully-formed Token is added to the search bar.</p>
    <p>Try typing a name or a number to begin.</p>
